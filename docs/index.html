        Araponga is a community platform oriented around <strong>territory</strong> (<strong>território</strong>):
        a living slice of the real world where people, memory, care, and responsibility take digital shape
        without becoming merchandise. This portal brings together product vision, domains, flows, and essential
        API documentation, now also published as a static site via GitHub Pages.

        <h2>Product brief</h2>
        <p>
          Araponga is a service for communities that want <strong>local visibility</strong> without giving up
          <strong>autonomy</strong>. Everything starts with <strong>territory</strong> (<strong>território</strong>):
          a real geographic cut that organizes the experience, defines context, and reduces noise. From it,
          two essential human layers emerge: <strong>visitor</strong> and <strong>resident</strong>. These roles are
          not just “authorization details”; they are the mechanism that sustains digital coexistence with respect
          for território and for people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of a global feed that captures attention, Araponga establishes a feed and a map that respond to
          território and to the bond. This allows the platform to prioritize what matters, protect sensitive content,
          and cultivate territorial memory — including, in the future, media anchored to coordinates that can compose
          richer layers and even spatial experiences (including 3D) when it makes sense.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Technical focus:</strong> domain-driven architecture, simple and auditable contracts,
        layered governance, and incremental evolution (MVP → advanced layers → spatial experiences anchored in territory).
        The goal is to build a solid core before accelerating features.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="domains" class="section">
      <div class="section-header">
        <h2>Domains</h2>
        <p>
          The domains exist to keep responsibilities clear and prevent social rules from mixing with
          representations of território. The intent is to protect system integrity: territory as reference,
          people as bond, content as expression, and governance as an explicit layer. Below are the essentials
          in the current stage.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          For technical reasons, the entities in the codebase are named in English (Territory, User, Membership,
          Feed, Map, Media, GeoAnchor), even when we discuss território in Portuguese.

          <h3>Territory</h3>
          <p><strong>What it is:</strong> a neutral geographic cut — the organizing reference of Araponga.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Why it exists:</strong> separates “where” (território) from “who” (people and bonds) and from
            “what” (content and layers). This lets the system evolve without distorting the core concept.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fields:</strong> id, name, slug, bounds, createdAt.</li>
            <li><strong>Endpoints:</strong> <code>GET /api/v1/territories</code>, <code>GET /api/v1/territories/{id}</code>.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>User</h3>
          <p><strong>What it is:</strong> authenticated identity to act in the system.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Why it exists:</strong> makes actions accountable without exposing sensitive data.
            The rule is: collect the minimum necessary, keep traceability of what matters, and protect what does not
            need to exist.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fields:</strong> id, displayName, email, status.</li>
            <li><strong>Endpoints:</strong> <code>POST /api/v1/auth/login</code>, <code>POST /api/v1/auth/register</code>.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Membership</h3>
          <p><strong>What it is:</strong> the bond between a person and a territory (visitor or resident).</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Why it exists:</strong> governs visibility, access, and local priorities.
            This domain is the operational heart of the rules: without it, the territory becomes a generic filter;
            with it, território becomes a context for coexistence.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fields:</strong> id, userId, territoryId, role, status.</li>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Feed</h3>
          <p><strong>What it is:</strong> posts, alerts, and events tied to territory.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Why it exists:</strong> distributes relevant information with visibility rules.
            The feed is “what is alive” in the territory: reports, notices, invitations, and memory in time.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fields:</strong> id, title, content, type, visibility, createdAtUtc.</li>

          <h3>Map</h3>
          <p><strong>What it is:</strong> georeferenced entities and layers of territory.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Why it exists:</strong> turns information into spatial reference.
            The map is not “just another screen”: it is the mechanism that situates what matters without depending
            on global noise and without standardizing território as a product.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fields:</strong> id, name, category, status, visibility, createdAtUtc.</li>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Media + GeoAnchor</h3>
          <p><strong>What it is:</strong> media (photo/audio/video) anchored in latitude/longitude (and, when useful, altitude).</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Why it exists:</strong> builds territorial memory with precision — and with control.
            GeoAnchor lays the groundwork for future layers: contextual visualization, trails, care records,
            and eventually more complex spatial representations (including 3D) generated from app data and media.

        <p>
          Two flows define the initial experience. Both are guided by territory and sustained by membership.
          The goal is not just to “work”: it is to work with social and spatial coherence in território.
